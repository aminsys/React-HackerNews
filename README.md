# Reactified Hacker News Web App - ⚠️ Work in progress ⚠️

The aim of this project is to present the website [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). The data is fetched from the [HN Search API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) together with firebase api via [HackerNews/API github](https://github.com/HackerNews/API?tab=readme-ov-file).

The website DOESN'T store the presented data and it ONLY parses the fetched data.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
